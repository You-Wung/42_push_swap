<h1>PUSH_SWAP</h1>

this code has a problem when we test "./push_swap 42".

need to fix first "if" phrase at the main.

it shouldn't run algorithm function.

other things, all works well.

i referred to two sites.

[1](https://www.notion.so/Push_swap-c8027851b4594de0927216ac2ede1aaa) for 3 arguments, 5 arguments.

[2](https://www.notion.so/push_swap-c15e62229b9541d78fadec4d6aae8b50) for 100 arguments, 500 arguments.

Good Luck!

Introduction
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.
Your goal ? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that
sorts the integer arguments received.
